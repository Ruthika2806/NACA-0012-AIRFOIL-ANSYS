# NACA-0012-AIRFOIL---ANSYS

This project is a re-creation of validation of Pressure and Velocity profiles of NACA 0012 airfoil using ANSYS Fluent. 
Spalart - Allmarus Turbulent Model is used for tis airfoil and the boundary conditions which are mentioned below are similar to the boundary conditions which have been used by the NASA for the validation. The report will give you an insight view of the project and the comparison of the results. 

## Boundary Condition

Pointed trailing edge.
Incompressible with Ma < 0.3.
Spalart - Allmarus Turbulent Model.
Reynold's Number = 6000000.
Density (rho) = 1.225 Kg/m3
Length = 1m
Velocity (u) = 88.65 m/s
Ma = 0.258
